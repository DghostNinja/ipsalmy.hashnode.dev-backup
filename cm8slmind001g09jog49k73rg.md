### Hello guys! Iâ€™m here again with another vulnerability, last one for the year 2024. Letâ€™s get startedÂ :Â )

Imagine trying to reset your password on one account, only to realize youâ€™ve inadvertently gained control over another. Thatâ€™s exactly what happened here. A session and OTP vulnerability allowed one accountâ€™s reset process to affect another, exposing a significant security flaw.

### The Discovery

It all started when I made an attempt to reset the password for one of my accounts (letâ€™s call this Account A)Â . The process seemed straightforward. Initiate a reset, get an OTP, and proceed. However, things took a turn when the email associated with the reset was swapped from Account A to Account B during the session.

Surprisingly, using the OTP sent to AccountÂ A, the password for Account B was successfully resetÂ *(H@ppynewy3@r!).* But hereâ€™s the kicker. Both Account A and Account B ended up with the exact same new password *(H@ppynewy3@r!)*.

At no point was the reset process for Account A explicitly completed. Yet, somehow, both accounts were affected simultaneously.

### Why Is This a BigÂ Deal?

This vulnerability suggests a fundamental flaw in how password reset sessions and OTPs are managed. Sessions and OTPs, which should be tightly bound to a single account, were instead loosely validated, allowing cross-account interference.

In simpler terms, if you can manipulate the session or account reference mid-reset, you can essentially gain unauthorized access to accounts you shouldnâ€™t have control over.

### The Fix

*Addressing this vulnerability would require*:

1\. Session Binding: Ensure sessions are strictly bound to the initiating account.

2\. OTP Validation: OTPs must validate against the original account and expire if context changes.

3\. Session Invalidation: Any mid-process changes (like switching emails) should invalidate the active session.

4\. Additional Checks: Double verification on sensitive operations, such as email or password resets.

### Final Thoughts

Password resets are often overlooked as simple, routine actions, but theyâ€™re also critical entry points for security vulnerabilities. This bug serves as a big reminder of how a single oversight in session and OTP management can lead to cascading security failures.

Lastly, Incase youâ€™re reading this from the future, Happy Hunting and Happy New Year! ðŸŽŠâ€¦â€¦.: )
