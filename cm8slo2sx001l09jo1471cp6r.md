*Hi! I'm* ***Psalmy****, welcome to the world of Web application Security.* ***OWASP(Open Web Application Security Project)*** *top 10 represents a list of most critical Web application security risks in the realm of cybersecurity. In this beginner friendly guide, I'll try to demystifying the Top 10 vulnerabilities as simple as possible, let's get started!*

1.  **Injection:** This occur when untrusted data is sent to an interpreter as part of a command or query. Imagine a spy infiltrating your favorite superhero team. Injection vulnerabilities are like sneaky intruders, manipulating an application's commands. These attacks can lead to data breaches, unauthorized access, and even complete system compromise.
2.  **Broken Authentication:** Involves issues related to improper implementation of authentication and session management. Let's see Authentication as gatekeeper ensuring only authorized users enter. But what if the gatekeeper nods off? Broken Authentication vulnerabilities explore these lapses, revealing how attackers might slip past the gates.
3.  **Sensitive Data Exposure:** Involves exposing sensitive data such as passwords, credit card numbers, or health records. We all have secrets we wouldn't want to be public. Similarly, web applications harbor sensitive data. Sensitive Data Exposure vulnerabilities expose these secrets to prying eyes.
4.  **XML External Entities (XXE):** Exploits vulnerable XML processors that parse XML input containing external entity references. XXE vulnerabilities occur when an application processes XML input from untrusted sources without proper validation, allowing attackers to read local files, conduct server-side request forgery (SSRF) attacks, or perform denial-of-service attacks. They are like magic tricks gone wrong, manipulating XML parsers to reveal hidden secrets.
5.  **Broken Access Control:** Occurs when restrictions on what authenticated users are allowed to do are not properly enforced. Access control ensures only authorized individuals access specific areas. Broken Access Control vulnerabilities challenge these restrictions. This can happen when developers fail to implement proper access controls or misconfigure security settings.
6.  **Security Misconfiguration:** Results from insecure default settings, incomplete or ad-hoc configurations, and open cloud storage. Ever left a window open unintentionally? Security Misconfigurations are like leaving your digital windows ajar, inviting trouble. These misconfigurations occur when systems, frameworks, or applications are not properly configured, leaving them vulnerable to attacks. Examples include default passwords, exposed error messages, or unnecessary open ports.
7.  **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** Involves the injection of malicious scripts into web pages viewed by other users. Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities are akin to digital pranks, injecting malicious scripts into web pages. This can lead to the theft of sensitive information, session hijacking, or the spreading of malware.
8.  **Insecure Deserialization:** Occurs when untrusted data is used to abuse the logic of an application, leading to a security compromise.Insecure Deserialization vulnerabilities play tricks with code, creating illusions that could compromise security.
9.  **Using Components with Known Vulnerabilities:** Involves using software components that have known vulnerabilities. Imagine building a fortress with a known weak spot. Using Components with Known Vulnerabilities is akin to having an Achilles' heel in your application because attackers often target known vulnerabilities in libraries, frameworks, or other software components to gain unauthorized access.
10.  **Insufficient Logging & Monitoring:** A lack of proper logging and monitoring, making it challenging to detect and respond to security incidents. An invasion can go unnoticed without proper monitoring. Insufficient Logging & Monitoring vulnerabilities allow silent attacks to unfold.

*Understanding the OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities is a crucial step toward creating resilient and secure web applications.*

*Stay safe!*
